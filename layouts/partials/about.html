    <p>Krahn Const. started as a home building crew in 1987 in
Aylmer, ON by George Krahn. He bought his first backhoe
in 1995 to help with the construction of the homes. The
company moved from there to the Leamington area and
it took off into smaller residential excavating jobs, septic
systems and such like.
KC now takes on larger earthmoving projects,
greenhouse site prep, storm drainage with its expanding
fleet of equipment and also has the resources and the
experience for the smaller scale jobs as well.</p>
   <p>
We've been serving Essex County, Chatham-Kent area and beyond since 2000.
Krahn Construction is constantly looking for new ways to safely and efficiently get the job done on time or ahead of schedule.    Using 3D GPS, 2D and laser guided systems on our equipment has eliminated the need for guesswork and makes for precision grading and getting it to design elevation as fast as possible.</p>
